She sat at his feet while he explained the program planned for the day. He had been teaching her different magic exercising primarily fire and air as common tools and defences. He had taught her healing and suggested that there were subjects within that practice which he would not teach. He had introduced her to the worlds beyond the one she could see, though again she sensed that he had held back much.

He sat by the fire, sipping something from a small bowl. As her eyes watered a bit, rinsing the soot with her tears, she could see that he had been watching her. Of course, he could have pointed to her directly an hour before he arrived. More than that, he was happy to see her.

It was only then that she forced her eyes to focus on a small black circle, no, a sphere on the ground between him and the fire. It did not sparkle in the flames, It did not glow with the heat. She was not even certain it was touching the ground.

Her voice trembled, "what is it?" She buried the deeper question of why her voice trembled by swallowing the pause for his reply. "That will take some work to discover."
That was how she came so recently to fall under the spell. He never touched it that she saw, but pushed it with air. He didn't ever speak of any specific danger, but she knew to treat this as though it might pose any kind of threat.
For days he would propose minor or lesser tests, treating her timid observations with the utmost seriousness. At night, they slept in shifts, but she wasn't sure whether they were standing guarding the orb or protecting it.
One night she woke to find her master explaining the challenge of learning about this orb while being unable to directly apply either his earthly or arcane senses to a large black bird. The size of the bird and its alertness at this hour would have suggested something unusual was going on even if she had not heard the bird respond in speech which was impossible for any bird to produce.
This might have set her afright had she time to respond before she was struck by the news the bird delivered. "There is an energy which might manipulate this, but you would do better to kill your apprentice and yourself than to expose yourself to that."
"No, no, I owe my salvation to one who cleansed me of that. If there is no way to interrogate the thing, can it be destroyed?" There was another extended pause during which the bird cocked its head to the side to let her know he knew she was there. "None that I can recommend."
