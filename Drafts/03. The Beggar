The few who knew his name called him Dolf, but most knew him by his countenance and would hesitate to speak to him at all. His mouth was so large as to leave just enough room for a weak chin. His eyes were too small and too close together and seemed to sit almost atop his beak-like nose. That nose had been broken more than once, unsurprising given its size and his surly nature. No one would call him hook-nosed anywhere he might hear.

He was especially good at hearing things he wasn't meant to. He might appear a beggar or he might mix among the laborers, but those who knew him as a member of the thieves guild saw him as an enforcer or perhaps a shot-caller. In fact, he was one of five who knew the identity of the guild leader. 

As a matter of course, he would keep the guild master apprised of the activities within his domain. Occasionally he would be given instructions to aid in some other. This amazed him as his master approached him in public with a small donation and a grape leaf, which he read and ate.

The taste was unpleasant, so he rose and signaled a large man who had been unloading goods from a cart.

It was time for breakfast.
