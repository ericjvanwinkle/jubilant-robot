As morning broke the clouds above must have brightened, but among the press of bodies shuffling down the streets draped in soot the shadows swallowed the meager gaslight lamps and it could have been midnight. 

The boy spotted his target. He had seen the man dropping a coin back into his purse after buying his food. It was more than the man needed and it would be enough for him to find a place to sleep for the day.

The food was seasoned bits of meat baked into a roll. The meats were the leavings from yesterday's stew-pots, of course, which were filled with the scraps from kitchens the night before. He could smell it as he slipped behind the man. It was finer than he was likely to eat today, and the smell was distracting.

He was so distracted that when the hand clapped over his face from behind, he had only just noticed his "mark" smiling down at him. From the right perspective, however, he didn't have to worry about where to sleep for the morning. When he awoke, he found it had been arranged for him.  

His head hurt and his throat was dry. He checked the cadence of his breathing and tried to make out his circumstances through the slits of his eyes. He dropped the pretense when he met the eyes of his captor. The man whose breakfast he had wanted had a hooked nose and a face he should have known sooner. This man was part of the local thieves guild and he was not. He had received jobs from a couple of guild members. Generally, the guild treated street urchins like himself as a talent development pool and let them feed themselves. So, why had he been picked up?

He sat up and rubbed the sides of his head. There was a musky taste in the back of his throat. "Can I get something to eat?"

He cheekily offered the man his coin.

The man snatched it but then, surprisingly, the man turned back to hand him a small cup of something slightly sweet smelling and a piece of bread. In some way, this was intended to be much more menacing than anything he had faced this morning, but he also knew he wasn't being threatened with poison. He also knew that his mind needed to be sharp. He dipped his bread in the cup and ate. The act of eating always calmed his mind.

He ate slowly. The drink was a weak beer with a little honey mixed in and the bread was stale, but chewing occupied him as he tried to understand what was happening. 

"Is this about that thing last week? We cleared it with the beggar and kicked up to him."

"I don't know why you are here or who wanted you here, I just brought you here and now I'm going to forget you were here. If you live through the next couple of hours, I expect you'll know more. Remember, boy, I'm being polite to you now. I never cheated you more than the cost of a lesson, but maybe there's more you should have learned so, keep your change." He tapped the boy's pouch and there was the clink of the coin somehow planted back on his person without his notice.

The hook-nosed man and the thug who must have grabbed him in the street left, closing the door behind them. 

The boy had always known that he was a bit too clever, so he did his best to disguise it. He knew the room he was in, now. It was a deep root cellar under one of the inns. He found his small blades were still concealed up his sleeves. He didn't bother checking any others. If they didn't disarm him this was a more dangerous situation than he guessed. 

He tried to sit on a barrel but found his feet didn't touch, so he hopped up quickly and sat with his back to the barrel. As soon as he tried to relax, the barrel slid several inches. He caught himself and cringed at the noise, but the elderly gentleman who opened the door at that moment gave him no notice until he had gotten to his feet.

"I am here to offer you an opportunity. If you decline, I can promise you a career within the guild. If you accept, you are committing to this path for the rest of your life and it will be a dangerous one. You have no family so you can choose freely." The man spoke like the wealthy families, but the boy thought there was some accent hidden underneath.

The boy studied the man's face trying to find any clue to the man's identity. The boy would recognize any of the local families of note, especially the wealthy ones. He would have known their servants. He knew the craftsmen and clergy.

"If you can speak for the guild, why recruit me to this other opportunity?"

"Very good. What I offer is less important than why. In all likelihood, I will benefit from your services as a guild member and perhaps more so in this other capacity, and finally because I have to send someone. I believe you know some letters." This last statement was made no louder or more significant in tone than anything else, but the boy felt the breath leave his body and the room swam for a moment.

He met the man's eyes with the meekest possible, "some, sir." A few years ago, he had been part of a confidence game where he impersonated the lost child of a rich merchant, but that had been far from here. He hadn't written a word since then, but he had learned to read, and he had made every effort to conceal that fact. 

He wouldn't gamble more than he intended to lose in order to  ingratiate himself with others, because he also understood figures and probabilities, and because he could recall every card he had seen dealt, every face he saw in the street, and every word he read. 

The man nodded curtly. How much could this man know? 

"I have, of course, chosen you specifically, but if you decline I will send someone else. You may learn why I selected you if you agree, but you must make your choice. If you would serve the guild and yourself, follow me now. If you would chance to serve a greater purpose still, then when it is time, I will come for you."

He turned. The boy was stunned. He was expected to decide his future with no information beyond the characterizations of a complete stranger, if presumably someone of power. 

He could leave now. He thought the only recommendation against this other path was a fear of the unknown. His life was already in danger daily. He took a calming breath and sat with his back against the barrel, now stable against the stocks behind it.

The man did not look back, and he closed the door behind himself. He saw no one at the door.

A short while later, he was brought a bowl of water the wash with and a plate of food, a chunk of bread with some stew which he ate greedily before splashing his face. 

Again, another man brought in a short tunic and breeches and another bowl of hot water, a piece of soap and a soft cloth. He didn't make eye contact with the boy or speak. Still, he understood the was expected to make himself presentable and wait.

He piled his rags on the floor and splashed the hot water on his chest and shoulders. He scrubbed with the soap and used the flat of one of his blades to slick the grime away before splashing himself with water again and drying and dressing himself. He guessed it was late in the day by the increasing din from above.

He assumed correctly that he was being observed, but as he ate and washed and changed his clothes, confirming they had left all of his knives on his person, he used the cover of each movement to covertly examine the small room for anything to hint at his purpose here.

He was especially surprised when, just as he was considering returning to his position on the floor two of the barrels against the wall and the wall itself, slid back. There was no sound of the wood scraping or stone sliding, but it swung open to reveal the old stranger, similarly dressed in simple garb, guiding him deeper a few stone stairs before following a fissure in the very granite mound the old city center had been built upon.
