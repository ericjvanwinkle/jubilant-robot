True to his word, the children could not speak of what they saw that night. Moreover, had they wanted to discuss it even with each other, they had no adequate words.

There had been little enough light from torches in sconces, but when the lamp was opened it got notably darker. Out of the aperture flowed something. It was only then that the children noticed two more men had joined the table. The new men began a low chant and the man with the book began reading while warily watching the thing over the edge of his book.

It moved like mercury, starting as a small grey blob floating out over the table, it spread tendrils to the edges of the table. A slit formed vertically across one side of the blob, and opened to reveal an eye. 

The chanting men sounded more urgent as the thing shifted from side to side. First, it had examined the men around the table. It extended a probe as though trying to touch the man with the book, or maybe the book itself, but stopped short as though restrained. Next, it leaned toward the children standing at the railing. 

For a few, they willed themselves to stillness, the rest were frozen in fear. It again seemed restrained from reaching them physically, but each of them felt more than its gaze. There was no way to compare their experiences, but each knew it had found in them something others could not see.

None of them remembered anything after meeting the gaze of the thing. They woke on pallets in three rooms of a four-cell dormitory. They slowly rose and gathered in the central common area.
